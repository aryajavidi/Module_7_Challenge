## Overview of the Analysis

 The purpose of our project is to identify the number of retiring employees by title and see which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. 
 
## Results

Based on the data that we collected, we can determine that there are currently two senior titles that make up a large portion of the total. A majority of the employees of retirment age hold senior titles, with Senior Engineer and Senior Staff comprising 64% of the total workforce. Many of those employed that are capible of mentorship are senior staff title holders and are of retirement age. The company will likely have a significant number of positions to fill within the next ten years.


## Summary
 The “silver tsunami” refers to the 64% of current employees that are of age to retire. These roles will need to be filled in preperation for a mass exodus from the company. Based on the parameters given to determine eligibility to become a mentor, there are not enough employees eligible to mentor the next generation of employees at Pewlett Hackard. 
 
 For future queries, I would reccomend increasing the eligibility pool of mentors to offset the impending shortage of mentors. This can be done by including those that may be born within the same or slightly larger age range, but are not eligible for retirement. These could be employees that have been with the company for long periods of time that are trusted within the company to hold a mentorship role but did not previosuly fit the requirements to be identified in this analysis, be it by age or title.
